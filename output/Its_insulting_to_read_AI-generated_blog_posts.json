In other words, LLMs were inadvertently trained to seem correct, and a little message that says &quot;Boom! Task complete! How else may I help?&quot; subconsciously leads you to think it&#x27;s correct.",

You might write something one way because you had an idea to try something in the future based on an idea to had while finding some bug. Or you might write it some way because some obscure part of the codebase. Or maybe because you have intuition about the customer.<p>But when AI writes the code, who has responsibility over it? Where can I go to ask why some choice was made? That&#x27;s important context I need to write code with you as a team. That&#x27;s important context a (good) engineering manager needs to ensure you&#x27;re on the right direction. If you respond &quot;well that&#x27;s what the AI did&quot; then how that any different from the intern saying &quot;that&#x27;s how I did it at the last place.&quot; It&#x27;s a non-answer, and infuriating. You could also try to bullshit an answer, guessing why the AI did that (helpful since you promoted it), but you&#x27;re still guessing and now being disingenuous. It&#x27;s a bit more helpful, but still not very helpful. It&#x27;s incredibly rude to your coworkers to just bullshit. Personally I&#x27;d rather someone say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and truthfully I respect them more for that. (I actually really do respect people that can admit they don&#x27;t know something. Especially in our field where egos are quite high. It&#x27;s can be a mark of trust that&#x27;s *<i>very*</i> valuable)<p>Sure, the AI can read the whole codebase, but you have hundreds or thousands of hours in that codebase. Don&#x27;t sell yourself short.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t mind the AI acting as a reviewer to be a check before you submit a PR, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the context to write good code. AI tries to write code like a junior, fixing the obvious problem that&#x27;s right in front of you. But it doesn&#x27;t fix the subtle problems that come with foresight. No, I want you to stumble through that code because while you write code you&#x27;re also debugging and designing. Your brain works in parallel, right? I bet it does even if you don&#x27;t know it. I want you stumbling through because that struggling is helping you learn more about the code and the context that isn&#x27;t explicitly written. I want you to develop ideas and gain insights.<p>But AI writing code? That&#x27;s like measuring how good a developer is by the number of lines of code they write. I&#x27;ll take quality over quantity any day of the week. Quality makes the business run better and waste fewer dollars debugging the spaghetti and duct tape called &quot;tech debt&quot;.",

As a human capable of nonlinear cognition, I can catch many of these mid-typing and fix them immediately, saving an significant amount of time compared to if I did not.

If you are adventurous, you might hunt a bug in some part of a large codebase, which usually leads you from the manifestation to the source of the bug on a fairly narrow path. None of this requires &quot;understanding all these huge codebases&quot;. Your statement implies a significant lack of experience on your part, which makes your use of LLMs for code generation a bit alarming, to be honest.<p>The only people expected to truly understand huge codebases are those who maintain them. And that is exactly why AI PRs are so insulting: you are asking a maintainer to vet code you did not properly vet yourself. Because <i>no</i>, you do not understand the generated code as well as if you wrote it yourself. By PRing code you have a subpar understanding of, you come across as entitled and disrespectful, even with the best of intentions.<p>&gt; That is just an opinion.<p>As opposed to yours? If you don&#x27;t want to engage meaningfully with a comment, then there is no need to reply.<p>&gt; I have projects I wrote with some help from the LLMs, and I understand ALL parts of it. In fact, it is written the way it is because I wanted it to be that way.<p>See, I could hit you with &quot;That is just an opinion&quot; here, especially as your statement is entirely anecdotal But I won&#x27;t, because that would be lame and cowardly.<p>When you say &quot;because I wanted it to be that way&quot;, what exactly does that mean? You told an extremely complex, probabilistic, and uninterpretable automaton what you want to write, and it wrote it not approximately, but <i>exactly</i> as you wanted it? I don&#x27;t think this is possible from a mathematical point of view.<p>You further insist that you &quot;understand ALL parts&quot; of the output. This actually is possible, but seems way too time-inefficient to be plausible. It is <i>very hard</i> to exhaustively analyze all possible failure modes of code, whether you wrote it yourself or not. There is a reason why certifying safety-critical embedded code is hell, and why investigating isolated autopilot malfunctions in aircraft takes experts <i>years</i>. That is before we consider that those systems are carefully designed to be highly predictable, unlike an LLM.",

From that I can somewhat rationally derive that if the company has been in business offer similar services for years, it is likely that they have processes in place to maintain a level of professionalism that would lower the risk of such lawsuits. And on an organisational level, even if I still have good reason to think that most of the employees are incompetent, the fact that the company is making it work gives me a significantly higher preference in the &quot;result&quot; than I would in any individual &quot;stupid&quot; component.<p>And for a closer-to-home example, the internet is well known to be a highly reliable system built from unreliable components.",

Even the best human SWEs create PRs with significant issues - it&#x27;s absurd by the parent to say that if a PR is &quot;any good, it wouldn’t need review&quot;; it&#x27;s just an unreasonable bar, and I think that @latexr was entirely justified in pushing back against that expectation.<p>As for the &quot;95% correctly&quot;, this appears to be a strawman argument on your end, as they said &quot;even if ...&quot;, rather than claiming that this is the situation at the moment.

Similarly if an AI review was any value-add for AI PR&#x27;s, it can be bolted on to the code-gen phase.  If editors&#x2F;reviewers have value in book publishing, they should read the books and opine and do the gate-keeping we supposedly need them for instead of telling authors to bring their own audience, etc etc.  I think maybe the focus on rituals, optics, and posturing is a big part of what really makes individual people or whole professions obsolete",

It&#x27;s more than just patterns and methods of phrasing. ChatGPT would say &quot;rhythm and diction and tone&quot; and word choice. But that&#x27;s just the paint. A voice is the expression of your conscious experience trying to convey an idea in a way that reflects your experience. If it were just those semi-concrete elements, we would have unlimited Dickens; the concept could translate to music, we could have unlimited Mozart. Instead—and I hope you agree—we have crude approximations of all these things.<p>Writing, even technical writing, is an art. Art comes from experience. Silicon can not experience. And experiencers (ie, people with consciousness) can detect soullessness. To think otherwise is to be tricked; listen to anything on suno, for example. It&#x27;s amazing at first, and then you see through the trick. You start to hear it the way most people now perceive generated images as too &quot;shiny&quot;.

And to their absolute credit, the author Eoin Colfer, in my opinion, pretty much nails Douglas Adams&#x27;s tone to the extent it is humanly possible to do so. But no matter how close he got, there&#x27;s a paradox here. Colfer can only replicate Adams&#x27;s style. But only Adams could add a <i>new</i> element, and it would still be his style.

I&#x27;d rather much read writings cleaned up by an AI than some incoherent fluff that really says nothing and wasting space.<p>And frankly, in my experience, writing with AI is no more easier than writing on your own. It&#x27;s just that my priority shifts from being distracted on those externalities (like fixing typos and formatting) to the subject matter of writing itself. So I go deep dive researching topics and contents at hand with AIs and try to figure out the best way to communicate the ideas to the audience with an AI. It takes time and it&#x27;s a work of its own. It takes hours depending on what I am doing.<p>And you probably wished I have cleaned this comment up with an AI, too! (I tried in my best human way given time I&#x27;m allowed).",

              "text": "I&#x27;m not the OP but I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a little bit since I read your question. Part of me says no, what could be more Sci-Fi than a complete and comprehensive story written by a computer. Who wouldn&#x27;t want Data to have been able to and succeeded at writing a story that connects with his human compatriots? On the other hand, I also understand the concern and feeling of &quot;something lost&quot; when I consider a story written by a human vs a machine.<p>But if I&#x27;m truly honest with myself, I think in the long run I wouldn&#x27;t care. I grew up on Science Fiction, and the stories I&#x27;ve always found most interesting were ones that explored human nature instead of just being techno fetishism. But the reality is I don&#x27;t feel a human connection to Asimov, or Cherryh, or any of the innumerable short form authors who wrote for the SF&amp;F magazines I devoured every chance I got. I remember the stories, but very rarely the names. So they might as well have been written by an AI since the human was never really part of the equation (for me as a reader).<p>And even when I do remember the names, maybe the human isn&#x27;t one I want a lot of &quot;human connection&quot; with anyway. Ender&#x27;s Game, the short story and later the novel were stories I greatly enjoyed. But I feel like my enjoyment is hampered by knowing that the author of a phenomenal book that has some interesting things to day on the pains caused by de-humanizing the other has themselves become someone who dehumanizes others often. The human connection might be ironic now, but that doesn&#x27;t make the story better for me. Here too, the story might as well have been written by an AI for all that the current person that the author is represents who they were (either in reality or just in my head) when I read those stories for the first time.<p>Some authors I have been exposed to later in life, I have had a degree of human connection with. I felt sadness and pain when Steve Miller died and left his spouse and long time writing partner Sharon Lee to carry on the Liaden series. But that connection isn&#x27;t what drew me to the stories in the first place and that connection is largely the same superficial parasocial one that the easy access into the private lives of famous people gives us. Sure I&#x27;m saddened, but honesty requires me to note I&#x27;m more sad that it reminds me eventually this decades spanning series will draw to a close, and likely with many loose ends. And so even here, if an AI were capable of producing such a phenomenal series of books, in a twisted way as a reader it would be better because they would never end. The world created by the author would live on forever, just like a &quot;real&quot; world should.<p>Emotionally I feel like I should care that a book was or wasn&#x27;t written by an AI. But if I&#x27;m truly honest with myself, the author being a human hasn&#x27;t so far added much to the experience, except in some ways to make it worse, or to cut short something that I wish could have continued forever.<p>All of that as a longwinded way of answering, &quot;no, I don&#x27;t think I would care&quot;.",

I asked him why he plays hockey if you can watch pros play it far better.  It&#x27;s the journey, not the destination.<p>I&#x27;ve been (re-)re-re-watching Star Trek TNG and Data touches on this issue numerous times, one of which is specifically about performing violin (but also reciting Shakespeare).  And the message is what you&#x27;re sharing: to recite a piece with perfect technical execution results an in imperfect performance.  It&#x27;s the _human_ aspects that lend a piece deep emotion that other humans connect with, often without being able to concretely describe why. Let us feel your emotions through your work. Everyting written on the page is just the medium for those emotions. Without emotion, your perfectly recited piece is a delivered blank message.",

Writing neatly was too slow for my thoughts, and I&#x27;d get lost or go off topic.

Even for tested material I was given proctored access to a type writer (and later computer). And my grades improved noticeably. My subjective experiences and enjoyment of my written school work also improved noticeably. Maybe I could have spend more years working on improving my handwriting and getting it to a place where I was just barely adequate enough to stop losing credit for it. Maybe I have lost something &quot;essential&quot; about being human because my handwriting is still so bad I often can&#x27;t read my own scribblings.

Blog posts are best for articulating unfinished thoughts. To that end, you are cheating yourself, the writer, if you use AI to help you write a blog post. It is through the act of writing it that you begin to grok with the idea.<p>But you bet that I&#x27;m going to use AI to correct my grammar and spelling for the important proposal I&#x27;m about to send. No sense in losing credibility over something that can be corrected algorithmically.",

The writer still curates, edits, and imbues meaning—just like a journalist editing a reporter’s notes or a designer refining Photoshop output. Tools don’t diminish creativity—they democratize access to it.<p>That said: if you’re outsourcing your <i>thinking</i> to AI (e.g., asking an LLM to write your thesis without engaging), then yes, you’ve lost something.
